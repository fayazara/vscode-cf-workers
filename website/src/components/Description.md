Enhance your Vercel deployment experience within Visual Studio Code. Monitor deployments, manage projects, and inspect deployment artifacts, all within your code editor.

The extension complements, rather than replaces, [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com) and [Official Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli). The purpose of this extension is not to replicate all the existing features but to offer actionable tools that developers can use within their code editor, reducing context switching and streamlining the Vercel development experience.
