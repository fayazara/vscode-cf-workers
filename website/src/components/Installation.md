# Installation

Here's a [link](vscode:extension/frenco.vscode-vercel) to open Visual Studio Code and go to the extension page. Or if your editor is supports extension marketplace, the extension is published under the publisher name `kyswtn` and can be searched for. Here's a [link to the extension's marketplace page](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=frenco.vscode-vercel).

The extension can also be installed through CLI.

```sh
code --install-extension frenco.vscode-vercel
```

If extension marketplace is not supported by your editor, please download the extension as a VSIX file [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/_apis/public/gallery/publishers/frenco/vsextensions/vscode-vercel/2.1.4/vspackage), and install it as the following. Replace `code` with your editor's program name.

```sh
code --install-extension frenco.vscode-vercel-2.1.4.vsix
```
