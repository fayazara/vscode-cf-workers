# Get Started

The extension integrates seamlessly with the Vercel CLI. Deployments are displayed based on available projects within a folder or workspace. Projects must be [linked](https://vercel.com/docs/cli/project-linking) first to be managed.

If you're not already signed-in, added sidebar view will display a button you can click to authenticate. Choose one of the available authentication options and complete.

Vercel CLI is not required to link projects. If no projects are linked, added sidebar view will display a button you can click to link a new project. In case of monorepos, right-click on a project folder and choose **Link to Vercel Project** option.

Once projects are linked, deployments can be browsed through. All other commands and features will also become available. _Enjoy_!
